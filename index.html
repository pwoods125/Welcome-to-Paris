            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Paris Woods, and I am a Temple University graduate with a Bachelor's of Science in Public Health. Due to my strong interest in computer technology, I have chosen to further my knowledge and pursue a career in computer software coding and web development, after nearly 13 years in healthcare. I am very experienced with operating computers, computer applications, researching using various databases such as PubMed, and operating Microsoft Office (word, excel, publisher, and PowerPoint). Also, I am currently honing my skills with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git and GitHub. Aside from my career and educational aspirations, I am also a passionate video gamer, and I co-host a video game podcast called "Meta Beta Gaming."</p>
            <p>One other thing I pride myself on is my empathy skills and ability to connect with people emotionally. It's important to me to understand that everyone has their own story that may affect the way act and respond to certain actions. Regardless, everyone deserves respect because one never knows what someone else is going through or has overcome. I prefer to treat people the way I would want to be treated. I am confident in my ability to make a positive contribution with any organization that is willing to offer me that chance.</p>
